# Forking a Repository on GitHub

To fork a repository on GitHub that you don't own, you'll need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you'll need to [create it](https://github.com/join) first. Once you have your account set up, you can follow these steps to fork the repository:

1. **Visit the Repository Page:**
   Go to the GitHub repository page you want to fork. In this case, it's: [https://github.com/ahfitzpa/code_to_genomes](https://github.com/ahfitzpa/code_to_genomes)

2. **Fork the Repository:**
   Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

3. **Clone Your Fork:**
   After forking, you'll have a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. To work with this repository on your local machine, you need to clone it. You can do this using Git by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/code_to_genomes.git
   ```
   Replace `YourUsername` with your GitHub username.

4. **Set Up Remote (Optional):**
   By default, Git will set the remote origin to your forked repository. However, if you want to keep track of the original repository as well, you can add it as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ahfitzpa/code_to_genomes.git
   ```
   This allows you to fetch changes from the original repository into your fork.

5. **Start Working:**
   Now you have a forked copy of the repository on your local machine. You can make changes, commit them, and push them to your fork on GitHub.

6. **Syncing with the Original Repository (Optional):**
   If you want to keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository, you can fetch changes from the original repository (upstream) and merge them into your fork:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
   This assumes the default branch name is `main`. If the default branch is different, replace `main` with the appropriate branch name.

Remember that when you fork a repository, you're creating a snapshot of it at that point in time. If the original repository is updated after you fork, you'll need to sync your fork with the original repository to incorporate those changes.
