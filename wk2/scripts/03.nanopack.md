# NanoPack Tutorial

## Introduction
Today we are going to look at some raw fastq files from a nanopore sequencing run. 
We will use a tool called NanoPack to do some basic QC and analysis of the data. 
NanoPack is a collection of tools for analyzing Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. 
It is designed to be a lightweight, portable, and dependency-free set of tools for basic analysis of nanopore sequencing data. 

## Step 1: Create Conda Environments for NanoPack
Replace 'user1' with the username of the first user
```bash
conda create --prefix /path/to/user1/nanopack_env python=3.8
```

Replace 'user2' with the username of the second user
```bash
conda create --prefix /path/to/user2/nanopack_env python=3.8
```

## Step 2: Install NanoPack within Conda Environments
Activate the Conda environment for user1
```bash
conda activate /path/to/user1/nanopack_env
```
Install NanoPack within the activated environment
```bash
pip install nanopack
```
Deactivate the Conda environment
```bash
conda deactivate
```
Activate the Conda environment for user2
```bash
conda activate /path/to/user2/nanopack_env
```

## Step 3: Run NanoPack
Activate the Conda environment for user2
```bash
conda activate /path/to/user2/nanopack_env
```

Now nanopack can be used within this environment
```bash
nanopack --help
NanoPlot --help
nanoQC --help
NanoComp --help
```

# Deactivate the Conda environment
```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Step 4: Run NanoPack on the Fastq Files
We will use the fastq files from the nanopore sequencing runs that I have downloaded. They are in fastq format
and are located in the directory /home/people/fitzpatria/training/wk2/data

Check the sra_metadata.csv file for more details on the fastq runs
```bash
cat /home/people/fitzpatria/training/wk2/data/sra_metadata.csv
```

Pick a run that you find interesting and let's try to run NanoPlot on it in a new slurm script
```bash
NanoPlot --fastq /home/people/fitzpatria/training/wk2/data/SRR5085902/SRR5085902.fastq --outdir /home/people/fitzpatria/training/wk2/data/SRR5085902
```

Now try and use NanoComp to compare some of the sequencing runs that have been downloaded
